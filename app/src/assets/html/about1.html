	        <hr />
			<p>With the publication of this Volume, I am happy to state that I have completely  fulfilled the onerous task set before me by His Holiness the late Jagadguru of  Sringeri. It was at Papanasam in the Tinnevelly District that His Holiness first  conceived the idea of a uniform and accurate edition of all the genuine works of the great world-teacher whose writings are the wonders of the world. This  publication was considered by His Holiness to be a fitting supplement to the  consecration of the temple of Sri Sankara at Kaladi. Accordingly His Holiness  commanded me to print and publish a uniform and as far as possible an accurate  edition of all the available works of this mighty intellect and make it a memorial  of the consecration at Kaladi. In obedience to His esteemed commands and with  the help of His divine blessings I commenced this publication in August 1909.  The difficulties that beset me were innumerable and I had to overcome them one  after another by sheer dogged pertinacity and by my firm faith in the  righteousness of His commands. A sum of Rupees Forty thousand had to be  invested before the work could be issued and though I unhesitatingly and  ungrudgingly provided the funds, I had to meet quite unforeseen difficulties  from unexpected quarters. The electric installation would fail me all on a  sudden, the engine would refuse to move a bit, the machine would break and the  necessary repairing facilities could not be had locally, types could not be  secured immediately, papers had to be indented for from England where labour  troubles would considerably impede their shipment, compositors would fall sick  and absent themselves at all times, proof readers would run away, pundits who  helped me would resent some imaginary affronts and keep away, near and dear  relations would fall sick, and some would even die thus upsetting completely  my mental equilibrium, these and others such as these, too numerous to detail,  have tried their utmost to dissuade me from my set purpose. But on all these  occasions invariably I had a cheering word or two from the lips of His Holiness  and His beneficent smile would goad me on to my task with renewed vigour and  fresh zeal. But for the living presence of His Holiness I would have become  bewildered in the maze of troubles and hindrances and would have sunk long  ago into oblivion. His Holiness would never leave me to that fate but would  drag me on ever onward into the path of brightness and sunshine and hold aloft  before me the banner emblazoned with the word “Excelsior” in letters of gold.</p>         
			<p>With such inspiring and ennobling guidance I was able to finish theprinting of ten volumes of the work by the time the Kumbhabhishekam  ceremony was performed at Kaladi, though six of the volumes only were then  bound and presented to His Holiness who graciously condescended to permit  me to dedicate the works to Him. In accepting these volumes His Holiness was  pleased to grant me the following Srimukha which speaks for itself. The third  paragraph especially details the pleasure felt by His Holiness while handling the  volumes. He compares it to the pleasure felt while reading the charming and  flowing and convincing style of the great Sri Sankara Himself.</p>

			<p>Since then the remaining portion of the work was done with all possible  speed and by the time His Holiness entered into His Maha Samadhi fourteen of  the volumes had been presented to Him though eighteen had been printed. His  Holiness who, as is well known, was a very great Sanskrit scholar and one of  the greatest exponents of the Advaita Vedanta in recent years, was so much  pleased with the accuracy of the edition that He always taught His discipleswith these volumes in His hands.</p>         
			<p>Whenever any doubt was felt in the readings or in the genuineness of any  particular work it was referred to the unerring decision of His Holiness and His  word was law. Thus I may assure my readers that all the works herein included  have had individually the sanction of His Holiness for being included in the  series. The Prakaranas and the Stotras were almost all of them repeated by His  Holiness from memory and were taken down from such repetitions. All  manuscripts that reached my hands were forwarded to His Holiness and those  only which were approved and corrected by Him were included. The last two  volumes form the Prapanchasara – the great Mantrasastra work, hitherto  unknown to the world. His Holiness hesitated a great deal before according me  permission to bring out this work and when such permission was granted and  when I secured some half a dozen manuscripts of the same, I found that it was  absolutely impossible to make head or tail of it without the help and guidance of  one who was well versed in Mantrasastra. And whom could I pitch upon except  His Holiness who was Himself a personification of Mantrasastra and  accordingly I implored Him to kindly go through the Mss. and edit the same. He  immediately condescended to do so and went through the first few chapters of  the book. But alas! it was not given to the world to enjoy this unique privilege,  for He departed all too soon to the greatest sorrow of all His disciples. His  disappearance at this stage was too great a shock to be borne by me and I would  have collapsed then and there but for the supreme sense of duty that was roused  in me in the matter of completely fulfilling His commands. So with a heart  devoid of all cheer, I proceeded with my task and eventually by His blessings  completed all the twenty volumes. After completion I took the first complete set  to Sringeri to lay them at least before the Maha Samadhi, since I had not the  good fortune and the rare privilege of placing them at the lotus feet of the great  Mahatma whose cheerful smile was and is ever my beacon star. But lo ! the all-  merciful kindness of His Holiness would not leave me in the lurch. He appeared  to me in person one night at Sringeri, accepted my humble gift of the complete  set, took each volume in His hand, went through a portion of the text and  expressed His approbation in unmistakable terms and cheered me considerably  by saying that the consecration of the great world-teacher Sri Sankara whom the  whole world reveres because of His works only, was complete just then, that the  greatest desire of His heart was accomplished by me and that He was glad I had  faithfully obeyed His commands. After half an hour’s most edifyingconversation and after intimating to me the honours which be had ordered to be  done at the Mutt the next day when I officially presented the books, He  disappeared leaving on me the stamp of His blessings. The next day in  accordance with official arrangement I presented the completed set of books  bound in silk in a rosewood box covered with specially embroidered lace work  to His Holiness the present Guru at the Navaratri Durbar held by Him. On that  occasion I read the following slokas:—</p>

			<p>His Holiness in accepting my tribute expressed Himself highly pleased  with the completion of the work and presented me with a Rudrakshamala set  fully with precious stones, repeating at the same time the following sloka.</p>         
			<p class="text-center fsan">श्रीशांकरी हि भवता वरपुस्तमाला भक्त्या सुवर्णघटिता गुरवे न्यवेदि ।<br /> तच्छांकरीं परमुदा भवते शिवाक्ष- मालां सुवर्णघटितां गुरुरन्वगृह्णात् ॥</p>         
			<p>In an elaborate Sanskrit discourse He dilated upon the meaning of the  above sloka and stated that the gift of the Mala which was worn by His Holiness  the late Jagadguru and of the title contained in the following Srimukha was in  obedience to the commands of His Holiness the late Jagadguru Himself. The  Srimukha runs as follows:—</p>

			<p>Besides these I was presented with a pair of lace shawls and thus ends the  most pleasant chapter of my life.</p>         
			<p>In this connection I will be failing in my most essential duty if I do not  acknowledge with deep gratitude the immense help rendered to me in the matter  of editing the books by the following eminent scholars and pandits.</p>        
			<ol class="staticcontent">          
				<li>Brahmasri Kunigal Rama Sastrigal, Dharmadhikari of Mysore, who went  through the Prakaranas and Stotras and corrected them in accordance with  the express instructions of His Holiness.</li>          
				<li>Brahmasri Vaidyanatha Sastrigal, Professor of Mimamsa Philosophy at  the Sanskrit Institute Bangalore, who was specially deputed by His  Holiness to stay at the Press with me for about 15 months and whose  services, rendered most willingly, were exceedingly helpful to me.</li>          
				<li>Brahmasri S. Subrahmanya Sastrigal Sanskrit Pandit, Tanjore, who also  stayed with me at the Press for about 6 months and who considerably  enhanced the value of his help by editing the last two volumes.</li>          
				<li>Brahmasri Kuppuswami Sastrigal M. A., Principal, Sanskrit College,Trivadi who is responsible for the careful editing of the Brahmasutra  Bhashya and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya.</li>        
			</ol>               
			<p>Besides the above, several other scholars have helped me then and there  with their valuable advice and suggestions and to all of them my thanks are due.  I am also indebted to the authorities of the Government Oriental Manuscript  libraries of Madras, Travancore and Mysore and to the authorities of the Adyar  Library and to several private gentlemen and friends, too numerous to mention,  for the ready manner in which they complied with my request to place at my  disposal the Mss. of the works of Sri Sankara available of them.</p>         
			<p>In conclusion, I would deem myself amply rewarded if, by the  publication of this edition, I have in any way helped towards the stemming of  the tide of materialism that sweeps over our country just at present and towards  infusing into the minds of the modern rationalists of India a respect and  reverence towards the teachings of the friend, philosopher and guide of India,  Sri Sankara Bhagavatpadacharya, the most rationalistic teacher the world has  ever produced and the mightiest intellect of whom India is always justly proud.</p>

			<p>P. S. — I would gladly welcome from the subscribers all expressions of their  opinion on this publication and their suggestions for its improvement which will  be very carefully considered in the second edition which is likely to be called  for soon. I would further thank my readers if they would intimate to me any  rare, valuable and hitherto unpublished commentaries on any of the works of Sri  Sankara which they may have come across, since it is my desire to publish all  the works of Sri Sankara with such commentaries.</p>
