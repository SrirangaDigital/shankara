	        <h5 class="feng">To save our classical wealth</h5>
	        <hr />
	        
			<p>The national conscience of our people, their love for their dear motherland and indeed their great veneration for their ancient heritages have never before manifested themselves in such a high degree as they are today. This noble spirit of national pride and love which is sweeping over the land at the present time is as deeply penetrated as it is widespread. There is not one branch of our activities – political, social, religious, artistic or literary – which it has not affected in some measure at least. While politically this national conscience has been roused to a remarkable high degree it is to be very much regretted that it has not shown itself to the same satisfactory extent in the preservation and spread of those priceless and revered heritage inheritances, those countless books and writings in Sanskrit and in other vernaculars by that noble band of sages, rishis, poets and kings whose footsteps we have the good fortune to follow today in this dear land of ours. These books which were written when other nations were either not dreamt of or were still barbarians are the wonder and amazement of the nations of the present day and have been the fountain, the perennial fountain, from which modern society and modern government have to drink deep. It is of the utmost importance and, indeed, it is the nation’s duty that it should lose not a moment’s opportunity in making every effort to save this most valued of gifts which is sure to be lost and forgotten through the ravages of time.</p>
			<p>The various other nations which have grown up since our time have developed their own institutions and their own literature, art and thought. A comparative study of these is essential to us today if we desire that our knowledge of the world and its peoples should be founded on a wider and more solid basis.</p>
			<p>Lastly it is necessary that we may keep ourselves abreast of the times a great deal more of assimilating the thought and works of other nations. The achievements of the world’s nations in science, technology, arts and philosophy have got to be familiarised to our countrymen by means of translations of books in foreign languages on these subjects.</p>
			<p>The preservation of our national culture and heritages, the comparative study of international thought and literature and the assimilation of foreign achievements in the sciences and arts are thus the three very important duties which have fallen upon our countrymen at the present time and which offer a wide scope for that abundant national activity which is seeking newer and newer channels every day along which to flow. Except for the spasmodic and occasional attempts of this or that Indian State, of this or that provincial Government whose sympathies often varied according as this or that man who was at the helm of affairs, there has been no organised and central body in this land of ours to do these, the most important, the most noble and the most patriotic of duties though organisations with far less noble and much less pretensions to a national cause have sprung up of late and have found ready support.</p>
			<p>To meet this desideratum this limited liability Company is formed with a capital of three lacs of rupees divided into 4000 shares of Rs. 50 each and 10000 shares of Rs. 10 each with a view to start a big central All-India Printing and Publishing House whose sole concern will be to fulfil the above-mentioned three very important duties.</p>
			<p>The promoters in their efforts to found such a central organisation have made their labours easy by resolving to purchase as a going concern the Sri Vani Vilas Press of Srirangam, that well-known firm of publishers and printers of ancient and national literature founded eighteen years ago, who have laid all Indians under a deep debt of gratitude by the zeal and enormous amount of work they have exhibited in bringing to light many hitherto unpublished classics in Sanskrit and Tamil which have won the approbation and even the admiration of eminent scholars throughout the world, a selection of whose opinions is appended hereto.</p>
			<p>The Press is fully equipped with the latest machinery in every department of the printing and publishing line and has got its own process, electro, stereotyping, gilding, dye-stamping and other allied departments.</p>
			<p>It has till now published several rare and valuable books and the present stock of the published works on hand is about one and a quarter lacs of rupees while the value of the works in the Press and of those under preparation will be about a quarter lac of rupees. The value of the plant together with all appurtenances is about Rs. 65,000 and the value of the stock of unprinted paper on hand is about Rs 20000. The goodwill, copyright etc. may safely be valued at Rs. 1 lac.</p>
			<p>While thus the value of the Press, its publications, goodwill etc. is estimated at about Rs. 3,35,000, the proprietor, as a true nationalist and in consideration of the patriotic work undertaken by the Company, has agreed to part with the whole concern for just Rs. 1½ lacs which is exactly half the capital with which the present Company intends doing work and which barely covers the value of the printed books and the stock of unprinted paper on hand. The gain which thus accrues to the Company at the very outset is not one of any small measure as practically the whole plant is obtained without any cost especially during these days when machinery is very scarce and dear.</p>
			<p>The Press at present is found to earn Rs. 1,500 a month and deducting the working expenses it is not too much to expect a dividend of at least 6 per cent from the very commencement on the capital of Rs. 1½ lacs invested on it. The Press is also running a weekly, the Hindu Message, an independent journal whose chief aim is to preserve the Indianness in the Indian. The Company is free to run the Journal on the same lines either as a weekly or as a daily.</p>
			<p>An agreement will be entered into between Mr T K Balasubrahmanya Aiyar, the proprietor of the Sri Vani Vilas Press and the Hindu Message, on the one hand, and the Sri Vani Vilas Syndicate Limited on the other, whereby the former will convey and transfer the goodwill of and all his proprietary rights in the Sri Vani Vilas Press (exclusive of the building) and the Hindu Message with all their assets including all existing contracts to the Sri Vani Vilas Syndicate Limited in consideration of the sum of Rupee 1,50,000 only to be paid in cash.</p>
			<p>It is earnestly hoped that every Indian with the least spark of the national spirit in him who desires to preserve the cultural unity of his race will find his way to subscribe for at least one share in the Company and, thus, participate in a scheme which is as noble as it is national, which is as patriotic as it is profitable.</p>
