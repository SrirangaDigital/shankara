			<p>THE LATTER half of the nineteenth century was a seed-time for Indian renaissance. Some of the greatest Indians of modern times were born then. Among them, Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Sri Aurobindo. Tamil Nadu was particularly rich in this respect. Subramania Bharati readily comes to mind. To this race of barrier- breakers belonged Gurubhaktha Sikhamani T. K. Balasubramania Iyer of Srirangam.</p>
			<p>Born in 1874, Balasubramaniam hailed from a prosperous family of Thanjavur. He showed a remarkable aptitude for scholarship when still young. Mastering Tamil, Sanskrit and English speedily, he graduated from S.P.G. College, Tiruchi. At this time a profound turning point was posited in his life when he met the 33rd Pontiff of Sringeri Sarada Peetham at Ayyambalayam village.</p>
			<p>H. H. Sri Sachchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati was a remarkable spiritual personality who was then engaged in tracing the genuine birthplace of Adi Sankara at Kaladi. Having decided to channel the unbounded enthusiasm of the young man for serving Indian culture, the Acharya asked him to publish classics of Indian religion and philosophy and authoritative editions, beginning with Sadasiva Brahmendra’s Brahmasutra Vriti. Balasubramaniam passed the test. Now came the Acharya’s command for what seemed a task meant for titans. An authoritative Collected Works of Adi Sankara! By 1904, Balasubramania Iyer turned in a superhuman effort, literally wrestling with destiny as it were to establish the legendary Vani Vilas Press at Srirangam. The finalisation of the Collective Works proved to be even more intractable. Was there one Sankara or many? Are all extant works that go by his name original? Could some of them be spurious? Thousands of manuscripts (handwritten on paper or palm leaves) were gathered and collated by the heroic editor. The different readings of the same work called for intense concentration to arrive at a final copy. These were indeed nerve-wracking years, but the steady backing and golden advice of his Acharya helped Iyer to keep moving forward.</p>
			<p>The Sringeri Acharya was himself on an equally strenuous trail during these years. After single-minded efforts he had found the authenticated birthplace of Adi Sankara at Kaladi and acquired it as well. In 1910 he consecrated a temple to Adi Sankara at Kaladi. During the ceremonies, he was able to release the first ten volumes of the collected works produced by Balasubramania Iyer. He spoke beautifully and with great feeling about the magnificent service rendered by his disciple to the cause of sanatana dharma:</p>
			<p><strong><em>“I have consecrated the image (moorthi) of Adi Sankara in this place, Kaladi. But Balasubramaniam has consecrated Adi Sankara’s fame (keerthi) all over the world through the Sankara Granthavali.’’</em></strong></p>
			<p>Planned as a series, the handy texts soon became the favourite of connoisseurs of scholarly works. Just when Iyer was immersed in the tasks associated with the completion of the project, Sri Nrisimha Bharati withdrew from the physical in 1912. This was a terrible blow to Balasubramania Iyer. However, service to the Divine goes on through the Guru Parampara. The 34th Pontiff of Sringeri, Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati, became an equally soulful guide and soon Iyer completed the project. It may be said that definitely one wise man’s dedication had saved the Sankara literature almost intact for posterity. Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati was overjoyed, adorned Iyer with an expensive makara kandi and a shawl and crowned him with the title, Gurubhaktha Sikhamani.</p>
			<p>What next? For one who laved in the ambience of Sankara’s philosophical and exegetical works, secular life had lost its savour. When the Sringeri Acharya visited Srirangam in 1924, Iyer laid all his earthly riches at the Guru’s feet. This was total surrender, a marvellous self-sacrifice. The Acharya was pleased and accepted the offering and blessed the disciple. But he asked Iyer to continue to serve the Divine by establishing a centre for Advaitic studies where the birthdays of Adi Sankara and Sri Nrisimha Bharati could also be celebrated. Accordingly, Iyer built a temple in his garden on Ammamandapam Road for Adi Sankara and opened a Sankara Gurukula to disseminate Vedic studies. Iyer also opened a spiritual library and named it Sri Satchidananda Bharati Bhandaram, storing it with rare books from all over India. Sankara Jayanti and special lectures made the Gurukulam famous in a very short time. By the late 1940s, age and relentless hard work had taken their toll on Balasubramania Iyer’s health. With his mind tuned to the Infinite, Iyer wished to renounce the world formally as well. The Sringeri Acharya acceded to his wish and gave his disciple the deeksha name of Sri Vijnananda Saraswati on June 3, 1947, as if to indicate that Iyer had risen from the mental plane (manomaya) to a supra-mental plane (vijnanamaya) of consciousness. The very next day Balasubramania Iyer became one with the Brahman.</p>
			<p>On the eve of the kumbhabhishekam of the Adi Sankara temple built by Iyer, it is astonishing to enter the environs and realise that this wonderful structure is the handiwork of a single person. Iyer had gone through every stage of the planning and execution of the temple. As we go in through the Rajarajeswari Entrance, we first gaze at the images of Rajarajeswari, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesa and Subramania. A long Mahamandapa, open on both sides, leads to a Mukha mandapa.</p> 
			<p>We then come face to face with the sancta sanctorum of Adi Sankara, Sri Nrisimha Bharati and Goddess Saradamba. Made of white marble, the figures are wonderful studies in contrast. All of them exude a rare compassion. Adi Sankara and Sri Nrisimha Bharati are draped always in ochre, but Mother Sarada is adorned with colourful silks and gleaming jewels. She carries a pot of nectar in her left upper hand and a garland of rudraksha beads on her right upper hand. The left lower holds a pack of cadjan leaves and the right lower hand is raised to promise guardianship. A parrot on the right shoulder signifies that Mother Sarada is the parrot in the cage of Pranava.</p>
			<p>Iyer was a great builder and also a very artistic one immersed in Puranic and Vedantic lore. His creative instinct found full play in the setting up of the Mukhamandapam. It is also called Ashta Lakshmi mandapam, because of its octagonal roof. The highest point at the centre has a painting of the blue heaven with stars, and opens out on a lotus encircled by the words “Brahmaiva Satyam”, the Pranava and two swans. A lower rung has iconic representations of the guru-parampara of Adi Sankara beginning with Narayana. The others are Brahma, Vasishta, Sakthi, Parasara, Vyasa, Suka, Gowdapada and Govindapada who was the guru of Adi Sankara himself.</p>
			<p>A still lower rung that forms the basal ribbon of the structure has figurines of eight Lakshmis. Each goddess has two emanations (kalas) and hence all the eight project the sixteen emanations of the Supreme Mother which are signified by appropriate symbols like the elephant, swan or pomegranate fruit. On the East Lakshmi is seen as knowledge and fame; on South-East she is wealth andguardianship; on the South Lakshmi’s is progeny and food; on the South-West courage and achievement are projected; on the West it is power and realisation; on the North-West, heroism and incalculable strength mark the goddess; on the North we see Lakshmi as victory and achievement; and on the North East Lakshmi denotes auspiciousness and Ananda. Throughout the basal ribbon the eight verses of the Hymn to Dakshinamurti have been inscribed in Sanskrit.</p>

			<p>THE CONCEPT of libraries meant for public use has been a revered tradition in India. Today, as it has become virtually impossible to have the luxury of personal libraries due to constraints of living space, public libraries ought to be maintained for the sake of the community. In this context it is good to know that the significant library of Sri Sankara Gurukulam at Srirangam is being renovated and refurbished. Having built the shrine for Adi Sankara at Srirangam and set up a school for teaching the Vedas and the Vani Vilas Press in the early decades of the twentieth century, Gurubhakta Sikhamani T. K. Balasubramania Iyer proceeded to create a library attached to the Gurukulam. The foundation for the Sri Sachidananda Bharati Bhandaram was laid in 1934, says the plaque in Tamil at the entrance to the large library hall.</p>
			<p>As one enters the long hall, the large portrait of Iyer’s mentor, Sri Shivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati conveys a gracious image of knowledge. This was the Mahapurusha who had found the exact place of Adi Sankara’s birth at Kaladi and raised a temple there! Flanking the portrait are four immense teakwood bureaus rising to a height of ten feet, with large glass doors. There is a total shelving space of 200 square feet filled with books. A few decades of total neglect have played havoc with the bindings and pages of nearly 60 percent of the books. As the helpers move around intent on their talks of renovation, I spend hours here.</p>
			<p>There are books and journals in three languages: Sanskrit, English and Tamil. Very few Tamil books are to be had. The parts of shelf space that are empty tell me that Tamil books have been borrowed often and either damaged totally or were never returned! It is not so with either Sanskrit or English. And what a treasure trove this room is with regard to classics in these two languages! Almost all of ancient Sanskrit literature.</p>
			<p>The works of Shankara, Vidyaranya, Appayya Dikshita and the works of the pontiffs who have adorned the Sringeri Sarada Math are but some of them. There are several surprises too. Rev. Emil Baer’s Pratyabhijnahrdayam, the books of Sanskrit grammar by F. Max Muller and M. Monier Williams, Surnad Kunjab Pillai’s Krishna Charita, a Sanskrit version of Shakespeare’s All’s Well that Ends Well and even a book on physics titled Amsubhodhini Sastra by Bharadwaja. The Gurubhaktha Sikhamani has drawn from several of the great publication groups like the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series, the Adyar Theological Publishing House and Bhandarkar Oriental Series.</p>
			<p>The collection of English volumes (some of them dating from the latter part of the 19th century) reveal the founder’s eagerness to go beyond Advaita in true traditional style. English literature itself is represented in rich hues.</p>
			<p>The World’s Great Classics released by the Colonial Press (New York and London) more than a 100 years ago has been given a perch in the Bhandaram. You just get lost in the 1900 edition of the second volume which is in excellent condition.</p>
			<p>At one time, the library must have been maintaining a rich spread of journals for the good of the public. Stray issues of magazines such as Vani Vilasini, Ramakrishna Vijayam, Kalyana Kalpataru(English and Hindi) and The Monthly Review and Review of Reviews eloquently proclaim the monthly/quarterly riches that one gained in the room in the first few decades after the founding of the library.</p>
			<p>For instance a bound volume of Review of Reviews (Horace Marshall, London, 1898) has as frontispiece a lovely portrait of Lady Curzon which is immediately followed by the editorial note on “press gag in India”.</p>
			<p>For several years, the Sri Sankara Gurukulam ran its own journal under the editorship of the founder. Here is a sample of the magazine for July-September, 1940. The printing is flawless. The matter is mostly in Sanskrit and runs into several series like a summary of the commentary of Sadasiva Brahmendra on Maneesha Panchakam, Appayya Dikshita’s poetic commentary on the Brahma Sutras titled “Nyaya Manjari” and Salva Timmayah Dandanatha’s commentary on Agasthya Pandita’s Bala Kandam.</p>
			<p>There is a fine review section also. T.K. Balasubramania Iyer’s Sri Hanumath Prabhavam is commended as it reveals several inlaid significances of the Ramayana. News and Notes gives the said information of the passing away of Jnanananda Saraswati Swami, father (in his poorvashrama) of Dr. M. Subbiah of Srirangam. The inputs in other issues include a reprint of the founder’s account of the marathon efforts to publish the collected works of Sankara, at the behest of Sri Sachidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati of Sringeri math.</p>
			<p>Even a visit to Sringeri was perilous as the place was surrounded by thick forests where wild animals roamed at will. But this haven lay within that area for those in search of peace and self-enlightenment.</p>
			<p>The issues of the Journal of Sri Sankara Gurukulam of latter years are mostly in Tamil. Obviously Sanskrit was being increasingly marginalised by the common reader; perhaps serious literature in English did not have too many takers!</p>
			<p>But the Tamil writings are equally thought-provoking and it is good to see that the journal provided a stage for women writers (Gomati Rajangam, Avudai Akkal, Ananthalakshmi Natarajan and others) as well.</p>
			<p>Seen from ever so many angles, the Sri Sachidananada Bharati Bhandaram has played a key role in conserving ancient culture for enriching the contemporary Indian. It is wonderful news to learn that the library will soon be in fine fettle and dedicate itself to the task of bringing higher learning to the common man.</p>
