	        <hr />
	        <p>I have much pleasure in congratulating you on the eminently satisfactory manner in which you have discharged the task imposed on you by his Holiness the late Jagadguru. I know you always felt immense joy in obeying the behests of His Holiness but the task set before you was so very gigantic and onerous that I naturally felt a little sceptic about its proper fulfilment. It is a matter for immense gratification that you have finished the work in a way highly creditable to yourself as most beloved of His Holiness' disciples and to us who justly feel proud in possessing such a splendid edition of all the works of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada in a most handy form. It was the earnest desire of His Holiness the late Mahaswamigal that such a collected edition should be brought out thereby publishing to the world an accurate version of the precious teachings of the great world-teacher and I may now safely state that his wishes in this direction have been amply fulfilled and you richly deserve all his eternal blessings. The edition now before me is, I am glad to observe, very carefully edited with the help of eminent scholars. The punctuations and the typographical arrangements make it very pleasant to read and understand. The get up is certainly worthy of the priceless treasures contained inside. In short I can state without the least hesitation that this edition is a considerable improvement on all the existing ones and is unique in that it includes several hitherto unpublished works also. I would conclude by heartily commending this publication to the liberal patronage of all the Chiefs, Notables and Mathadhipaties of India.</p>
